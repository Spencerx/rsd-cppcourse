Installation Instructions
=========================

Introduction
------------

There following appendix gives instructions for installation of the packages
we'll be using during the RITS Autumn 2013 C++ course.

If you have already followed the Software Carpentry instructions, you will have done most of this already.

Operating Systems
-----------------

Linux users should be able to use their package manager to install all software requirements, and should have C++ and a decent editor already.
(if you're using Linux, we assume you won't have any trouble with these requirements).

However note that if you are running an older Linux distribution you may get older versions with different look and features.
A recent Linux distribution is recommended.

Mac and Windows users should follow the instructions to the left.

Working through the install
---------------------------

Give yourself 30 minutes or so to run through this installation process and don't get intimidated!
Please try to install everything well before the bootcamp,
as it is important that we don't waste time during the workshop trying to mend installations.

If you do get stuck, first try searching on the internet (e.g. [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com)) for solutions.
Or, try asking a fellow bootcamp attendee for help.

Eduroam
-------

We will be using UCL's [eduroam](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/staff/wireless/eduroam) service to connect to the internet for this work.
So you should ensure you have eduroam installed and working.

Installing Boost
----------------

You will also need, part-way throught the course, to install **Boost**.

If the main instructions are hard to get through, you can leave that till
prompted during the course. Otherwise, [start now](03install_boost)
