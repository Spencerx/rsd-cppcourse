Intensive C++ for Research
==========================

Welcome to the first of the new UCL Research IT training courses: ``Intensive C++ for Research''.

What this course is and is not.
------------------------

This course is not:

* An introduction to programming: you are assumed to be already able to program in some language.
* A comprehensive introduction to C++ syntax: we will introduce the language ad-hoc as we progress.
* A gentle course: the course is intensive, and assumes a highly intelligent trainee with the willingness to commit time to the learning process.
* A software engineering course: while we will touch on some aspects of good software engineering practice, this will not be the focus.

This course is:

* Primarily intended for quantitative scientists: the focus and examples will emphasise numerical aspects.
* Interactive: by following the examples, you will have constructed for yourself a working C++ program capable of real science.
* Short: a good student should be able to work through all the material in around 25 hours.
* Selective: we will touch on only a tiny fraction of what C++ offers.
