title: Adding species to a reaction

Exercise: Adding Lists of Reactants
===================================

Adding lists of reactants
-------------------------

In this exercise, you should add methods to our Reaction class to accept a Species and add it to a member variable vector storing reactants or products.

You should also add methods receiving back the vector of reactants and the vector of products.

You should construct appropriate tests, with appropriate fixtures.

Our solution for this exercise is tagged as [`v1.5`](https://github.com/UCL/rsd-cppcourse-example/tree/v1.5)

Have a look at my [changes](https://github.com/UCL/rsd-cppcourse-example/compare/v1.4...v1.5)
