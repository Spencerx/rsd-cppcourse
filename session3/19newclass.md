The Reaction System Class
=========================

An empty class
--------------

A reaction system is a system of several reactions.

Create a new ReactionSystem class, with all new boilerplate code, and a new test file, which does nothing.

The tag for this [solution](https://github.com/UCL/rsd-cppcourse-example/compare/v2.0...v2.1) is [`v2.1`](https://github.com/UCL/rsd-cppcourse-example/blob/v2.1/reactor/src/ReactionSystem.h)

The system can store species
----------------------------

Add functionality to be able to store a list of species, as pointers.
