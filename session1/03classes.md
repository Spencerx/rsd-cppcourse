An introduction to simple classes
=================================

Here we'll look in more detail at defining a user-defined type, or Class.
We'll see that we need to specify two things: how other sections of the code will interact with the class, which we call the *interface*,
and the internals of how the class works, which we call the *implementation*.

The Species header file
-------------------------------

Have a look in your editor at src/Species.h

First of all, this file has a file extension ".h".

C++ and C source files come in two flavours: header files and non-header files.

We use .h files to describe the **interfaces** to things, and .cpp files to actually define what they do.

So we can describe, in src/Species.h, that our user-defined type, or *class*, called Species,
exists, and that it has a *member function* called GetName():

``` c++
class Species // A "class" is a user defined type with built-in functions
{   
  std::string GetName(); // declare a member function that takes no arguments, and returns a string.
};
```

Here, `std::string` refers to the string type, which is not a part of the C++ language itself, but is part of the
standard library. `std::` is used to refer to things from the standard library.

because we've done this, when we have our reaction system, we can ask it for it's name:

``` c++
calcium.GetName();
```

note the dot operator is used to get access to the method of the reaction system. We refer to functions which are part of a
class's abilities like this as *member functions* or *methods*.

This, the defining of user-defined types which contain their own custom built-in methods, defines the
basics of "object" based programming. It is the user-defined type which is called a class. Any particular *instance*
of the class is refered to as an *object*.

We note also that we define a function called the same as the name of the class:

``` c++
Species(std::string input_name);
```

This describes a special function called a *constructor* which is used by the 
language for making new Speciess. We invoked
it in the main function when we said:

```c++
Species calcium("Ca");
```

We also define that the class has a member *variable* as well as member functions, to store the name:

```c++
class Species
{   
private:
  std::string name;
}
```

In principle, we could access this directly with a dot in outer code:

```c++
std::cout << calcium.name << std::endl;
#Â Instead of:
std::cout << calcium.GetName() << std::endl;
```

however, we might in future change the way the name of a system is stored, so it is traditional good practice
never to directly access member variables. We *enforce* that the user of our class doesn't try this with `private`.

If we try this, we get an error message on compiling with `make`:

> ```
> /Users/jamespjh/devel/rsdt/rsd-cppcourse-example/reactor/reactor.cpp:15:126: 
> error: 'name' is a private member of 'Species'
> ```

Namespaces
----------

When you are working with other people's code, it can be very very annoying if they have a class called Solver or some other common name,
and so do you. Your code is working fine, you bring in their library, and suddenly there's a bug because you're both using something with the same name.

To get around this problem C++ allows `namespaces`. Something in a namespace must be referenced with the name preceding it like we saw in the main program:

``` C++
reactor::Species myspecies;
```

We can surround a section of code with a namespace declaration, as we do in Species.h:

``` C++
namespace reactor
{
  class Species
  {
  	...
  }
}

Everything declared inside the namespace declaration becomes part of the namespace, and it is not necessary to explitly reference it with a `namespace::` declaration.

Finally, as in our test file, you can simply import everything from a namespace into another one, including the default global namespace:

```C++
	using namespace reactor;
```

We can now see that in `std::string` we're referencing `string` from the `std` namespace. Some programmers just import the `std` namespace with `using namespace std`, but
I recommend against that practice: in general it's better to spend a few extra characters for more clarity. There is a saying for this "explicit is better than implicit."

The Species definition file
---------------------------

We can now look at the implementation of these methods in `species.cpp`:

``` c++
std::string reactor::Species::GetName() 
{ 
	return name;
}
```

which obviously just returns the current stored value. What is the point of this?
We've gone to all that trouble to hide the data as `private` and now we're just writing a function which returns that value.
This is considered best practice because the way we store the name might change: for example, we might have short and long names.
We would like to change the internals of the class more often than we change the interface, so we use *accessor methods* like these.

Now, the constructor could be defined as:

``` c++
reactor::Species::Species(std::string input_name)
{
        name = input_name;
}
```

in fact we do something different:

``` c++
reactor::Species::Species(std::string input_name)
         : name(input_name)
{
}
```

which means **exactly** the same thing: it's so common for constructors just to boringly pass on arguments like this,
that the language designers created a shortcut, called an initialiser-list. (We call this "syntactic sugar"!)
Where no confusion can occur, if using an initialiser-list, the standard even allows constructor arguments and member data to have the same name, so we could have written:

``` c++
reactor::Species::Species(std::string name)
         : name(name)
{
}

Const correctness
-----------------

In the above I've been writing `std::string` here when the astute reader will notice the file actually has `const std::string &`. What in the world is this all about?

We like to specify at in our code which variables should be changed by a function, and which will not. That way, the compiler will complain if we try to change
a variable which we should not, which will help prevent us from creating bugs. In addition, knowing which methods can and cannot change variables can help
the compiler create much more efficient machine code.

Therefore, whenever we declare a variable which we guarantee will not change, we can specify `const` as part of the type: `const int`, `const double` or `const Species`.

That means that in this function, the variable will not be changed.

References
----------

That explains the `const`, but what about the `&`? When we create a method, by default, the variables will be copied into new memory spaces for the new subroutine.
Compilers are quite good at realising when this is unnecessary, but we can make this specific by writing an & as the last symbol of the type. This means that the new
variable is really just a reference to the old one. (Python and Java users will realise all their functions work like this!) This is just a summary of the complex meaning
of `&` in C++, we will look at this much more in next week's session on memory management. We can also say that a whole *method* doesn't change any of the variables
of the class, by writing `const` *after* the name of the method.
